        <h1>My experience in college so far</h1>
        <h2>by: Paulina Guadalupe</h2>
        <p>
            When I first got to <i>City Tech</i>, I had started as a Computer Information Systems major
            but I realized I wouldn't be able to thrive in that field for several reasons, I 
            needed some form of a creative outlet and I came upon the <i>Communication Design</i> department. I've been
            in this major for the past couple semesters and I feel like I made the right choice. Despite this,
            I'm still not sure what direction I actually want to take my career in. 
            <br> 
            No matter what I do in the future, what <i>I aspire</i> to do is be able to work on something that I am truly
            passionate about and something that i can find fulfilling.
